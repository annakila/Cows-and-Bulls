# Cows-and-Bulls
Topic
As discussed in class, the topic for the team project this semester is the WORD version of the Bulls & Cows game.

For a feel of the game visit the links in the previous item on the team project.   

Submission Requirements:
At the end of the semester, EACH student must submit a ZIP file containing

1. A project report (in Word format) covering

a) a description of the program,

b) the challenges that you and your team had  and how did you or the team overcome them,

c) what you have learned by doing the project,

d) a discussion of algorithms and techniques used in the program,

e) contributions of each team member (peer evaluation), 

f) any suggestions you may have (optional).

2. A short video clip demonstrating the program in action. (If the video is too big you can post it on a website, e.g. youTube, and submit the link). The video should have audio narration explaining the moves of players.

3. All MIPS assembly language modules that are needed to run your program.

4. A user manual on how to run and how to use the program.

Obviously items 2. 3 and 4. are the same for all team members but item 1 must be prepared by each student individually (but some sections of the report, e.g. a) and d), can be shared).

Make sure you write what have you learned by doing this project and peer evaluation part individually.

Minimum requirements while implementing the game:
For each game, the program randomly selects a WORD from a list of eligible words (i.e. must have 4 non-repeated letters and is a meaningful English word, e.g. WORD, CALF, VERB, DUCK, etc...). Teams can write a program in a high-level language to generate the list of words to be used for the project from a dictionary. The list must have a minimum of 100 different words. 
The program must display the guess number, 'Guess' and 'Result' similar to the one shown on the Wikipedia page, but obviously the 'Guess' must be a word and replace the result with something likes '0 Bull and 1 Cow' instead of 0A1B. 
Allow the user to give up and display the word so that the user can see what it was.
If the user correctly guesses the word, display the time spent.
An error message is displayed to explain the rule that was violated if a input by the user was not valid, e.g. input a word that is not 4 letters, or a word that has repeated letters.
Extra credits will be given for:

Extra features of the programs (different sounds or music to indicate valid/invalid moves and winning, or music is played during the game) implemented and documented.
Any other notable creativity that the team has shown.
Please document these extra credit features in your report and explain well to unlock these extra credits.

How will marks be given to team members?
First, the implementation and documentation of the game will be graded based on the requirements listed above.
Then the peer evaluation section of the project report (section e) will be taken into consideration when assigning marks to each team member. 
Teams should get together as soon as possible to discuss the requirements and decide on how to break down the task to assign to each team member. Feel free to contact the TA/Graders or the instruction if more information is needed.
